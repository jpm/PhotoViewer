# Photo Viewer

Forked from [henrik's PhotoViewer](https://github.com/henrik/PhotoViewer) which is forked from [enormego's EGOPhotoViewer branch](http://github.com/enormego/PhotoViewer).

Originally based on Facebook's three20 library, now rewritten.

Features an optional thumbnail view, rotation, zooming, loading spinners and a "failed to load" error image on failure.

This fork now includes an "edit mode" feature for the thumbnail view.

Open the demo project and run to see how it looks.

For now, you use it in your own project by just including the stuff from the `Library` folder and making sure to include the `QuartzCore` framework in your project. Then just do what the demo project does.
